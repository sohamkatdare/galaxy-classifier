# galaxy-classifier

- This is a novel residual neural network (RNN) architecture for autonomous classification of galaxy morphologies.
- Model includes over 70 layers and millions of neurons and parameters and was trained on a dataset of >300k galaxy images.
- Includes efficient data-loading pipeline with custom-built data augmentation methods to prevent long training times and decrease model overfitting.
- Implemented convolutional layers for image analysis, as well as a skip connections in structure to prevent vanishing gradient problems.
- Reached a classifictation accuracy of over 90%, as compared to an accuracy of 62% of the most popular method of classifying galaxies, citizen science (50% more accurate).

**Technologies used: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**
